            <h1>How AI is Reshaping Healthcare</h1>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence is increasingly embedded in medical practice, offering faster insights and 
                more personalized care. Below are several representative applications:
            </p>
            <section>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smart Diagnostics:</strong> Algorithms analyze X-rays and MRIs to highlight anomalies such as fractures or tumors earlier than traditional methods.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accelerated Drug Research:</strong> Machine learning shortens the timeline of pharmaceutical discovery by processing huge biomedical datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tailored Therapies:</strong> AI systems recommend treatment plans based on patient-specific genetic and clinical information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Assistants:</strong> Chatbots manage routine tasks such as scheduling, billing, and answering FAQs, freeing staff for complex care.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <p>
                Collectively, these innovations enhance accessibility, reduce costs, and contribute to better patient outcomes.
