            <h2 class="heading2">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Artificial Intelligence, or A.I., is a rapidly growing field in Information Technology. Simply put, it refers to computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and translating languages.</li>
                <li><strong>A.I. in Everyday Life:</strong> A.I. is no longer just a concept in sci-fi movies; it is already a part of our daily lives. We see it in the voice assistants on our phones, like Siri and Google Assistant, in chatbots that understand what we type, and even in the development of self-driving cars and robots.</li>
                <li><strong>Why is it Trending Now?</strong> Recently, tools like ChatGPT have made headlines for their ability to understand complex questions and draft entire essays from just a few prompts. Businesses are now rushing to adopt A.I. technologies to stay ahead in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-box">
            <h2 class="heading2">How does AI learn?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The key to all machine learning is a process called training, where a computer program is given a large amount of data - sometimes with labels explaining what the data is - and a set of instructions.</li>
                <li>The instruction might be something like: "find all the images containing faces" or, "categorise these sounds".</li>
                <li>The program will then search for patterns in the data it has been given to achieve these goals. It might need some nudging along the way - such as "that’s not a face" or "those two sounds are different" - but what the program learns from the data and the clues it is given becomes the AI model.</li>
                <li>Over millions of years, the natural environment has led to animals developing specific abilities, in a similar way, the millions of cycles an AI makes through its training data will shape the way it develops and lead to specialist AI models.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section-box">
            <h2 class="heading2">Can I talk with an AI?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If you've used Alexa, Siri or any other type of voice recognition system, then you've been using AI.</li>
                <li>Imagine a rabbit with its big ears, adapted to capture tiny variations in sound. The AI records the sounds as you speak, removes the background noise, separates your speech into phonetic units - the individual sounds that make up a spoken word - and then matches them to a library of language sounds.</li>
                <li>Your speech is then turned into text where any listening errors can be corrected before a response is given. This type of artificial intelligence is known as natural language processing.</li>
                <li>It is the technology behind everything from you saying "yes" to confirm a phone-banking transaction, to asking your mobile phone to tell you about the weather for the next few days in a city you are travelling to.</li>
            </ul>
